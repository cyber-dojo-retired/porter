runner needs to be careful that id can be used as container-name.
hash the id?
What are the rules for a container-name
`[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_.-]`
cannot be one char long either.
The reality is that container-names generated by docker itself
are [0-9a-f]*
require 'digest/sha1'
Digest::SHA1.hexdigest 'foo'
"0beec7b5ea3f0fdbc95d0dd47f3c5bc275da8a33"
which is 40 characters long
real docker container ids are 64 chars long.
in a regular docker ps -a container ids are shown 12 chars long.
runner-stateless:DONE
runner-sttateful:TODO

Base58 needs to ensure every single letter of the alphabet
can be used as part of a dir name.
