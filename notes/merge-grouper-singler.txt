Don't have grouper/singler as separate services.
Have one server. keeper?

terminology?  groups, katas
in root-dir-names
  s/grouper/groups/
  s/singler/katas/

Also drop /ids/ from root-dir-names

Having a single keeper service
o) makes it much easier to merge
   the state from one server onto another
o) reduces the need for BatchMethods
   eg get katas in a group.

extend the method names,
eg create x 2 --> create_group/create_kata

Makes it clearer that the manifest stored in the
individual-kata needs the full information, eg image_name
but the manifest stored in a kata-in-a-group
only needs
o) its own id
o) group-id
o) avatar-index

grouper.manifest() does not return files.
Would be better if it did I think.
Then it becomes the inverse of create(manifest,files)
Simpler to just put the files into the manifest
