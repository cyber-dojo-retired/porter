I have decided to switch to 6-char identifiers on grouper/singler.

This allows me to use a plain 6-char identifier and grouper/singler
will not require id-completion at all.

However, it does make it more likely that moving grouper/singler
katas from one server to another will result in an ID collision.
The larger the alphabet, the less the chance of an ID collision.
Merging grouper and singler into a single service would make
data merges a bit easier?
Suppose there are collisions in a merge?
It would be possible to create an id-collision map
in the same way porter will have to do when its ports storer data.

Note also, that the ID currently becomes part of the name of the
docker container the runner runs.
Are there restrictions on the name of a docker container?
Would it be better to decouple these and hash the ID inside
the runner?

Suppose there are 200,000 katas in storer.
At an average of 5 avatars per kata.
Thats 1 million singler IDs. Ok.

I currently use Base58 but drop L (uppercase and lowercase).
So alphabet.size == 56

Remember the id is spelled out phonetically.

not using...
- minus. too similar to hyphen
" doubleQuote. can make naming the dir in shell tricky
' singleQuote. can make naming the dir in shell tricky
/ forwardSlash. can't be used as dir name
\ backSlash. can't be used as dir name on windows?
~ tilde. used for home dir.

What other characters could I reasonably use?

! exclamationMark
@ at
# hash
$ dollar
% percent
^ caret
& ampersand
* asterisk
: colon
? questionMark
< lessThan
> greaterThan
+ plus
{ leftCurlyBracket
} rightCurlyBracket
[ leftSquareBracket
] rightSquareBracket
( leftRoundBracket
) rightRoundBracket
= equals
; semiColon
| pipe
. dot
, comma


another 24
(56+24)^6 == 80^6 == 262,144,000,000 == 262 billion

vs           56^6 ==  30,840,979,456 ==  30 billion


It is tempting to use 7 chars...

80^7 == 2.09x10^13 == 20.9 trillion
56^7 == 1.72x10^12 == 1.72 trillion

Downside is people are used to using 6 char IDs
