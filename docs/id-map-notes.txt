You might be restoring from several snapshots.
In this case I need to consider the behaviour
of port(id10) when id10 has already been ported.
The simplest is to return the id6 it has already been assigned...
This is a bit tricky since it is possible (however unlikely)
that the id10[0..5] has been taken not as a port of id10
but as a duplicate id (in storer) port.
So porter needs to keep a record of all the mappings....

port(id10)
  porter keeps record of mapping for both
  matching ids and mapped ids.
  Viz 420F2A2979 --> 420F2A  matching means
     /porter/matched-ids/420F2A2979   no need for content in file
  Viz 9fH6TumFV2 --> x45jKs different means
     /porter/mapped-ids/9fH6TumFV2    content of file == x45jKs

Now, port(id10)
  1. raises if id10 exists in storer
  2. raises if id10 exists in /porter/matched-ids or /porter/mapped-ids
