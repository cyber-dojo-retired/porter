I have decided to switch to 6-char identifiers in saver.

This allows me to use a plain 6-char identifier and saver
will not require id-completion at all.

However, it does make it more likely that moving saver katas
from one server to another will result in an ID collision.

Suppose there are 200,000 katas in storer,
at an average of 5 avatars per kata.
Thats 1 million saver (singler) IDs. Ok.

I currently use Base58

Remember the id is spelled out phonetically.

not using...
- minus. too similar to hyphen
" doubleQuote. can make naming the dir in shell tricky
' singleQuote. can make naming the dir in shell tricky
/ forwardSlash. can't be used as dir name
\ backSlash. can't be used as dir name on windows?
~ tilde. used for home dir.

What other characters could I reasonably use?

! exclamationMark
@ at
# hash
$ dollar
% percent
^ caret
& ampersand
* asterisk
: colon
? questionMark
< lessThan
> greaterThan
+ plus
{ leftCurlyBracket
} rightCurlyBracket
[ leftSquareBracket
] rightSquareBracket
( leftRoundBracket
) rightRoundBracket
= equals
; semiColon
| pipe
. dot
, comma

Problem with these is many of them are not allowed, as-is, in a URL.

another 24
(56+24)^6 == 80^6 == 262,144,000,000 == 262 billion

vs           56^6 ==  30,840,979,456 ==  30 billion


It is tempting to use 7 chars...

56^7 == 1.72x10^12 == 1.72 trillion
Or more...
56^8  == 96.7x10^12 == 96.7 trillion
56^9  == 5416.694x10^12 == 5416.694 trillion = 5.41 quadrillion
56^10 == 303305.49x19^12 == 303305.49 trillion = 303.30 quadrillion


Downside is people are used to using 6 char IDs
