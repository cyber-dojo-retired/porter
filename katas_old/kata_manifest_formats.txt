Kata manifest formats
=====================

Old-style kata manifest.json files
----------------------------------
Contain the following 7 keys
      "id":                  "340B87D5BE",
      "created":             [2015,9,9,5,29,38],
      "language":            "Python-py.test",
      "exercise":            "Fizz_Buzz_Plus"
      "tab_size":            4,
      "visible_files":       {...},
      "unit_test_framework": "python_pytest"
      "browser":             "..." (only in really old katas)

Note that they do _not_ contain the image_name key
which has to be retrieved via starter.manifest(language).
This coupled them to starter (via web).


New-style kata manifest.json files
----------------------------------
Contain the following keys
      "id":                  "0587D5BE87",
      "created":             [2017,11,23,5,29,38],
      "exercise":            "Fizz_Buzz_Plus"
      "tab_size":            4,
      "visible_files":       {...},
      "runner_choice":       "stateless",
      "image_name":          "cyberdojofoundation/python_behave",
      "display_name":        "Python, behave",
      "filename_extension":  ".py",
      "progress_regexs":     [],
      "highlight_filenames": [],
      "lowlight_filenames":  [...],
      "red_amber_green":      "lambda..." (NO LONGER USED)


Note that they _do_ contain the image_name key
and are thus are not coupled to starter.
