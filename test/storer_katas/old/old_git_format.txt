Storer used to save [test] event visible-files in a git format.
This created a lot of small files which put pressure on inodes.

Storer now saves [test] event visible-files in a non-git format.
This reduces the inode pressure.

Until and unless conversion is done, storer still needs to retrieve
data stored in the old git format.

In order to test the storer correctly retrieves data stored in the
old git-format I need katas with known kata-ids created in the
old git-format. This dir provides that.
Specifically, 5A0F824303.tgz (for example) untars to provide
/5A/0F824303/spider/.git
Note that I provide the tgz file and the test run untar it into the container.
I do not provide (in the storer git repo) the already untarred 5A/... dir.
This is because having a sub-dir with a .git dir in a git repo is problematic.

Old Git format details
----------------------
E.g, if the kata-id=F72C61785F, avatar=lion, tag=17
then the visible-files are retrieved via...
  manifest = `cd .../katas/F7/2C61785F/lion && git show 17:manifest.json`
  visible_files = JSON.parse(manifest)

New Git format details
----------------------
E.g, if the kata-id=F72C61785F, avatar=lion, tag=17
then the visible-files are retrieved via...
  manifest = `cat .../katas/F7/2C61785F/lion/17/manifest.json`
  visible_files = JSON.parse(manifest)
